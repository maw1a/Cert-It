# Cert It!

Cert It! is a web based and android based app that aims to provide and generate certificates over a range of many templates that can be chosen by the user. The user can enter his or her details
through a .csv or .xlsx file (containing data in a predefined format having multiple users) or they can list out their own requirements to generate a single certificate.


## Problem Statement

There are numerous companies and organizations out there that are providing certificates to their participants / winners. Sometimes , even educational organizations have to provide a load of 
generated certificates to their people. This process gets pretty hectic since its a very repetitive task.

 - Allow the user to upload their own template and generate certificates.
 - Allow the user to upload a snapshot of the handwritten data in a specified format through which our app will recognize the necessary details and map it out to generate a certificate.

 We have also devised another tool for generating certificates. The Google assistant bot was built using Google's dialogflow.

And then accordingly , our program maps the necessary keywords and generates a certificate.
